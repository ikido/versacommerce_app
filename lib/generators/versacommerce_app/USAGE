Description:
    This is a generator for creating a basic VersaCommerce application to quickly get
    you started. You can see some examples on how to use the VersaCommerce API.
    
    The generator creates a basic sessions controller for authenticating with your
    Shop and a controller called "home" which displays basic information 
    about your products, orders and articles.
    
    Note: It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the 
          generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.

Usage:
    Pass your API key and then your Secret, which the sessions controller 
    will need to authenticate with your shop. 
    If you don't have an API key yet, register your application with us.

    
Examples:
    rails/generate versacommerce_app aabbccddeee112233445566 ppooiikkkhh99887...
        
    This will create a sessions controller and a home controller and views.
